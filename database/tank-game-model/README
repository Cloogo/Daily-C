My first attempt to writing a small game server running on LAN used tcp and mysql.
However,when developping the client,i find something terrible happends.
Without the function of broadcast,i have to use polling method to 
dectect the changes,causing the overhead of cpu.
The scheme to fix it is to keep the socket of
the clients.
Another problem is that the protocal between server and client is unreliable.
Some packets may
be sent separatedly ,however,read in sever togother,causing the undefine actions in server.
The solution to solve this problem is to apply upd instead of tcp.And try to reconstruct the
data.
As for how to test the server?
Oh,my god!How terrible the server!
It's of fun.I need more knowledge.
